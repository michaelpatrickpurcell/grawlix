# Grawlix
Grawlix is a two-player, perfect-information, [abstract strategy game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game) which is based on the [thirty-six officers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares#Thirty-six_officers_problem).

The name of the game refers to a term coined by Mort Walker to describe a string of typographical symbols that writers, particularly cartoonists, use as a replacement for profanity.

## Components
The only components required to play Grawlix are a flat _play area_ and thirty-six _tiles_.
Each tile is labeled with one of six possible _glyphs_ and one six possible _colors_.  There is exactly one tile for each unique combination of glyph and color.

The six possible glyphs are:
  - @ (at symbol)
  - \# (pound sign)
  - $ (dollar sign)
  - % (percent symbol)
  - & (ampersand)
  - \* (asterisk)

The six possible colors are:
  - Red
  - Orange
  - Yellow
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Purple

## Set Up
All of the tiles should be placed face up on one side of the play area. These tiles are called the _supply_. It may be helpful to arrange the supply as a 6x6 grid in which each column consists of all of the tiles of a given glyph and each row consists of all of the tiles of a given color.

The players should decide which one of them will be the _first player_.

Starting with the first player, the players then take turns _drafting_ tiles. To draft a tile, a player should choose one tile from the supply and add that tile to their _hand_.

The set up phase is complete when both players have drafted four tiles.

All tiles, both in the supply and in the players' hands, should be visible to both players at all times.  

At the beginning of the game, there are no tiles in the play area.

## Gameplay
The players will take turns playing tiles from their hands to the play area until one of them is unable to do so.

After playing each tile, if there are any tiles remaining in the supply then the current player should choose a tile from the supply and add it to their hand to replace the tile that they played.

If a player is unable to play a tile on their turn then that player loses the game.

### Playing Tiles
On their first turn, the first player should play a tile from their hand by placing it face up anywhere in the play area.

On every subsequent turn, the current player should play one tile from their hand by placing it face up next to another tile in the play area. Tiles must be placed such that:
  1. At least one edge of the new tile is aligned with an edge of another tile in the play area.
  2. The glyph of the new tile is different from the glyph of every other tile in the
     - row in which it is placed.
     - column in which it is placed.
  3. The color of the new tile is different from the color of every other tile in the:
     - row in which it is placed.
     - column in which it is placed.
  4. After placing the new tile, the tiles in the play area span no more than six rows and six columns.
