\section{Gameplay}
The players should take turns playing tiles from their hands until one of them is unable to do so.

After playing each tile the current player should draft a tile to replace the tile that they played. If there are no tiles in the supply, then they should skip this step.

If a player is unable to play a tile on their turn then that player loses the game.

\subsection{Playing Tiles}
On their first turn, the first player should play a tile from their hand by placing it face up anywhere in the play area. This tile is the first tile in the grid.

On later turns, the current player should play a tile from their hand by placing it face up next to a tile in the grid. After it is played, this tile becomes part of the grid.

When a new tile is played it must be placed in the play area such that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item At least one edge of the new tile is aligned with an edge of another tile in the grid.
  \item The glyph of the new tile is different from the glyph of every other tile in the:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item row in which it is placed.
    	\item column in which it is placed.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The color of the new tile is different from the color of every other tile in the:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item row in which it is placed.
    \item column in which it is placed.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The grid has no more than six rows and six columns.
\end{enumerate}
